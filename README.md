# smartweave-loot

A simple [LOOT](https://www.lootproject.com/)-like contract, which allows to generate and transfer different magical assets, like for example `black silver sword` or `blue gold crown`. Each asset will be unique and can belong to only one wallet at a time.

Initially there are no generated assets, but users will be able to generate and claim them.
Users also will be able to transfer their assets to others.
